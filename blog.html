			<p> Hello and welcome to my project blog, where I document most of the projects I am currently doing during my time in Singapore Polytechnic as an Engineering Academy
			Student!</p><br><br>
			
			<h1>CA3 Project:Smart Response Gadget for Elderly living alone(ElderTrack)</h1>
				Done by Ahmad Rifaaie Bin Mohamed Ali and Cai Yanru.
				<h2>Design Thinking and Project Planning Stage</h2><br>
				Initially me and Yanru had both come up with different ideas on what we were going to do for our CA3. We initially planned to do a resistor sorter which would ease off
				the process of sorting out resistors found through the lab and would install a straightening system to straighten out the wires, so they can be used by other students.
				However, the system to design such a complex idea would be very troublesome and we both agreed to drop it. Instead, we both decided to work on an IoT system that can
				be used by nurses to provide help to the elderly in the nursing home, without requiring the elderly to leave their room if they are too sick or are unable to do so. Through
				the help of Mr Teo Shin Jen, we were introduced to the world of IoT which we had ZERO experience in. But we slowly got the gist of it and started practicing our newly found 
				skill in IoT through tutorials provided by Mr Teo through the AWS and online instructables done by others in order to further enhance our knowledge. I personally tried to do
				an IoT doorlock system and the Noisy Nancy instructables which was done by an SP student.<br><br>
				
				We tested our microphone sensor using the code given by the Noisy Nancy instructables, and it was functioning well.Try to get an ESP32. We decided that after some consideration 
				about the limitation of implementing our smart system in solely rooms which doesn't cover the elderly when they are outside. We both agreed to work on a hand held gadget which is
				strapped on the elderly which if they need assistance, they can call for help by presssing on a touch/fingerprint sensor to send an SMS to a nearby nurse to assist them. This
				allows the elderly to be covered fully throughout the elderly home.<br><br>
				
				After a series of discussion between Yuan Ru and me, we decided to repurpose our product to focus solely on the elderly who live alone in their HDBs, this is due to how the elderly
				in nursing homes are well taken care of and are always being watched. These reasons showed us that elderly who live alone in their own HDB units require more assistance than those 
				who live in nursing homes that are being well taken care of by the nurses and staff alike. <br><br>
				
				We both unanimously agreed on a project that is to be easy to use by the elderly and to guarantee a quick response system to get social workers to assist the elderly at a 
				minute's notice. This project was to focus solely on the programming aspect with a hint of electrical. Hence, we decided to begin the next phase of our project which was the Prototype Stage.<br><br><br>
				
				<h2>Prototype</h2><br>
				I got to Sim Lim Square to buy electrical components needed for the project. I also requested several components which are a bit too expensive to buy on the market such as a fingerprint sensor and voice sensor.
				We initially wanted to make a smart room for the elderly to live in a elderly home, but changed that to be a simple response gadget as it was too much work to do. We used a NodeMCU as our main microcontroller for
				the whole project. In order to make it more simple for the elderly to use, we used a capacitive touch sensor so that all the elderly need to do is to touch it like a smartphone in order to send out an SMS to their
				nearby community centre to send a social worker to assist them.<br><br>
				
				Yanru got started on testing out the SMS system with some help from a tutorial that she found online regarding the ThingSpeak software. After a series of testing with the application, we began to realise that
				working with the application was a bit too difficult for us considering our experience in IoT. But Yanru found a different application which was the IFTTT software which made our job of designing the SMS system 
				easier. And after testing out solely with the NodeMCU to see if it could send an SMS to our phones, it worked! Then we moved on to our next step which was to integrate the touch sensor into our current circuit.<br><br>
				
				Integrating the touch sensor into the circuit was a lot of work, as we were both unsure of how to treat it like a switch to trigger the SMS response to our phones. After consulting with Mr Teo, a couple of EA seniors
				and online tutorials that we found online. We finally made a breakthrough as our touch sensor was now able to be work as intended by pressing it for 5 whole seconds to allow the user to send out an SMS to the community
				centre. We gave it 5 seconds to allow the elderly to stop, should they accidentally press it. Then, we decided to add an LED that will trigger when the SMS is sent out to the community centre to let the elderly know
				that the SMS has been sent out and received by the community centre. With the circuit completed, we decided to focus now on actualising the product.<br><br><br>
				
				<h2>Actualisation</h2>

			    <h1> CA2 Project EED Year 2 Sem 1</h1><br>
                <h2> Planning </h2><br><br>
                <p>
				I first started experimenting with potentiometers on TinkerCAD, initially making an idea about using potentiometer for my CA2, however, I decided to make use of
				the mini project my friend Sorenson and I did over the long holidays after the end of our 1.2 Semester which is a servo motor controlled by a rain sensor.
				I changed from a servo motor to a DC motor in order to accomodate the function of a transistor which helps to control the actuator which is the DC motor. The initial function of such a circuit would be to help design
				an automated system for trains or even automated cars in the near future to drive slower in rainy weather. Due to the lubrication caused by the rainwater be it on
				the train tracks or roads, this helps to ensure the user's safety by comprimising the speed of the vehicle as more rain begins to pour down. I also plan to fit in an 
				LED in order to warn the train operator/car driver that the vehicle is starting to slow down in order to counter the rainy weather. 
				And without wasting time, I decided to put my idea into TinkerCAD instead of putting it down on a sketch as it is time wasting and couldn't immediately give me results
				straightaway.<br><br>
				
				</p>
				<h2> TinkerCAD Simulation</h2><br><br>
				<p>
				During the TinkerCAD Simulation, I encountered issues such as having high negative rpm which is very unusual and after some help from friends in EA, they simply
				added a flyback diode(1N4001) to help focus the direction of the voltage which decreased the amount of RPM and making the reading become positive, which gave me 
				confidence that my idea could work but I needed to exerrcise caution considering the use of DC Motors which could potentially damage my microcontroller, the SPEEEduino.<br><br>
				
				Below I attached two TinkerCAD simulations I did, one with an Ultrasonic Sensor and one with a Potentiometer, which is an alternative for my rain sensor. I wanted to try out and 
				see how an ultrasonic sensor could work with my dc motor, however I still have yet to touch up on that as I was focusing on my getting my rain sensor circuit up and running. Since
				most people were attempting to do something with the Ultrasonic Sensor, I wanted to see this for myself out of curiosity.<br><br>

				CA2 Circuit, Rain Sensor Circuit, using a Potentiometer as an alternative to the rain sensor.<br><br>
				
				Judging from the circuit, I may need to buy some components from Continental Electronics in order to make my circuit as some of them are not available in the FabLab.
				Hence, I needed to get started on work quickly and buy those components with some spares, should they fail during testing. However, this project in my opinion, is so
				far a workable and potentially useful idea in the future considering upcoming technologies such as automated driverless cars which could use systems such as this
				in order to ensure the safety of the user.
				
				</p>
				<h2> Breadboard Testing</h2><br><br>
				<p>
				Using the FabLab at T1442, to get my materials, I went out to get a 1N4001, two 330 ohm resistors, a DC Motor and a Red 5mm LED. I personally bought a TIP120 
				transistor, 1 set each of F-F, M-M and F-M jumper wires, 1 raindrop module as well as my own soldering kit, as the Fablab did not have any of them available.
				Working with friends, I was able to get my circuit working exactly just like the TinkerCAD simulation, with a sufficient amount of positive RPM, and the DC Motor speed 
				decreases as more water is poured on the rain drop module. However, through advices from my friends in the school of EEE, I found out that it is not really that necessary
				to have an external power source such as a 4x1.5v Battery in order to run my circuit. They instead, adviced me to run it using just the Arduino 5v connection, which I took
				in, in order to save time and effort. I initially tested it with an external power source on the circuit as seen in the previous header. However, I feel that this would
				provide a more cost effective and simplified solution to have my circuit running especially in such a short amount of time.<br><br>

                As I began to start work and gather materials for soldering, some of my friends from EA warned me that the soldering process in this project was going to be rather 
				tedious. I took that advice with as much caution as I can. With the help and advice of some of my friends from EEE who are more experienced in soldering components
				to stripboard, they helped to teached me about the connection and the layout of stripboards which was useful knowledge for me to better understand how to solder my parts
				onto the stripboard. I couldn't be more thankful for their help as I begin to take on the toughest part of the whole project which I feel that I may have to take certain 
				gambles to try and make whatever I can to showcase my project.

				<h2> Stripboard Soldering</h2><br><br>
				<p>
				Due to the lack of time constraint and my onset fever and cold, I was only able to solder as much as my components and some of the wiring for testing on the stripboard.
				I had to focus on the soldering at home which I was able to solder to the point my LED started working but my DC Motor wasn't running. However, after some testing, I 
				realised some of the copper was getting burnt out and as a result, some of the connections were severed and I had to make use of some of the other connections in order to
				accomodate this error. As a result, I was able to get my DC Motor running but my LED was nowhere near showing any lighting and the RPM of the DC Motor was too much despite
				the installment of the 1N4001 diode. Hence, I needed to design another idea as soon as possible with the little time I had left.<br><br>

				Backside of Project in Progress<br><br>
				
				However, I ran through some issues regarding my soldering as the copper connection in the two lines has caused a major discontinuity which resulted in my two important
				pins, my 5V and GND connection to be short circuited, as a result, I had to resolder my whole circuit in order to avoid this discontinuity. This definitely cost me some 
				time and effort in order to account for such an error and gave me a lost of sleep through the night.

				<img src="solderremove.jpg" alt="Soldering RemoveTop" height="400px" width="600px"><br><br>
				
				I got started on removing the solders of certain wires and connections in order to rectify this error. The digital pin outputs and LED connection had to be resoldered
				to other points on the stripboards in order to fit in with the 5V and GND connection. I carried on this work till 5am on the morning of the due day.<br><br>
				
				After a morning waking up with a fever,a cold and 3 hours of sleep,I rushed off to work as I try to meet the deadline. I asked friends all around for advices and through their help,
				I was able to get my circuit working, however due to a soldering mishap which caused a little more discontinuites in my circuit, my LED could not respond and as I had 
				no spare LEDs or stripboards around. And as my desoldering pump was jammed due to blockage, I was unable to carry on anymore desoldering works which left me in a disadvantegeous
                position. With no other options available and time running out, I had to present this product with just the DC Motor being controlled by the rain sensor which is technically,
				the heart of the project.<br><br>

				<h2>Final Product(For Marking)</h2><br><br>

				Below, is the video demo of my CA2 Circuit in Action, do take note that the LED is not working due to the soldering errors in my circuit and I had to take the pill container
				from my paracetamol medicine to act as my rotor to show the spinning motion of the DC motor as I did not had any other objects available to serve as the rotor.<br><br>
				
				<a href="https://youtu.be/K4pgTius3p8">Video of Final Soldered Product CA2</a><br><br>
				After quite a while, I managed to solder this much of my product despite the shortcomings of the LED, being able to show the DC Motor being controlled by the rain
				sensor was what I believe to be a top priority in ensuring that my CA2 product is a success. Personally, I feel that it is incomplete due to the absence of the LED
				acting as a warning system to warn the operator that the train is slowing down, I hope that in the near future, I could revisit this project and eventually make it grow
				into a commercially viable idea in the near future for automated transport systems.<br><br>
