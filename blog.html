                <h1> Planning </h1>
                <p>
				I first started experimenting with potentiometers on TinkerCAD, initially making an idea about using potentiometer for my CA2, however, I decided to make use of
				the mini project my friend Sorenson and I did over the long holidays after the end of our 1.2 Semester. I changed from a servo motor to a DC motor in order to 
				accomodate the function of a transistor which helps to control the actuator which is the DC motor. The initial function of such a circuit would be to help design
				an automated system for trains or even automated cars in the near future to drive slower in rainy weather. Due to the lubrication caused by the rainwater be it on
				the train tracks or road, this helps to ensure the user's safety by comprimising the speed of the vehicle as more rain begins to pour down. I also planned to fit in an 
				LED in order to warn the train/car driver that the system is starting to slow down in order to counter the rainy weather. 
				And without wasting time, I decided to put my idea into TinkerCAD.<br><br>
				
				</p>
				<h1> TinkerCAD Simulation</h1>
				<p>
				During the TinkerCAD Simulation, I encountered issues such as having high negative rpm which is very unusual and after some help from friends in EA, they simply
				added a flyback diode(1N4001) to help focus the direction of the voltage which decreased the amount of RPM and making the reading become positive, which gave me 
				confidence that my idea could work. As a result of this, I went out to start working on my idea using a breadboard.<br><br>
				
				
				</p>
				<h1> Breadboard Testing</h1>
				<p>
				Using the FabLab at T1442, to get my materials, I went out to get a 1N4001, two 330 ohm resistors, a DC Motor and a Red 5mm LED. I personally bought a TIP120 
				transistor, 1 set each of F-F, M-M and F-M jumper wires, 1 raindrop module as well as my own soldering kit, as the Fablab did not have any of them available.
				Working with friends, I was able to get my circuit working exactly just like the TinkerCAD simulation, with a sufficient amount of positive RPM, and the DC Motor speed 
				decreases as more water is poured on the rain drop module. However, through advices from my friends in the school of EEE, I found out that it is not really that necessary
				to have an external power source such as a 4x1.5v Battery in order to run my circuit. They instead, adviced me to run it using just the Arduino 5v connection, which I took
				in, in order to save time and effort. I initially tested it with an external power source on the circuit as seen in the previous header. However, I feel that this would
				provide a more cost effective and simplified solution to have my circuit running especially in such a short amount of time.

				<h1> Stripboard Soldering</h1>
				<p>
				Due to the lack of time constraint and my onset fever and cold, I was only able to solder as much as my components and some of the wiring for testing on the stripboard.
				I had to focus on the soldering at home which I was able to solder to the point my LED started working but my DC Motor wasn't running. However, after some testing, I 
				realised some of the copper was getting burnt out and as a result, some of the connections were severed and I had to make use of some of the other connections in order to
				accomodate this error. As a result, I was able to get my DC Motor running but my LED was nowhere near showing any lighting and the RPM of the DC Motor was too much despite
				the installment of the 1N4001 diode. Hence, I needed to design another idea as soon as possible with the little time I had left.<br><br>
				
				After a morning waking up with a fever and a cold, I rushed off to work as I try to meet the deadline. I asked friends all around for advices and through their help,
				I was able to get my circuit working, however due to a soldering mishap, my LED could not respond and as I had no spare LEDs or stripboards around, I have to present
				this product with just the DC Motor being controlled by the rain sensor.
				
				
				</p>
				<h1>Final Product(For Marking)</h1>
				<p>
				<a href="https://youtu.be/K4pgTius3p8">Video of Final Soldered Product CA2</a>
				After quite a while, I managed to solder this much of my product despite the shortcomings of the LED, being able to show the DC Motor being controlled by the rain
				sensor was what I believe to be a top priority in ensuring that my CA2 product is a success. Personally, I feel that it is incomplete due to the absence of the LED
				acting as a warning system to warn the driver that the train is slowing down, I hope that in the near future, I could revisit this project and eventually make it grow
				into a commercially viable idea.
